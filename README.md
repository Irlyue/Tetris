# Teris

## On Linux
1. First install the following libraries
```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

2. Then run the shell script
```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

3. The former step generates an executable file `teris`, run it and you're good to go.


## On Windows
